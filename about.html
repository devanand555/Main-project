        <p>A singular flavor experience with contrasting layers: a crisp wafer shell coated in chocolate
        , pieces of softly roasted hazelnut, a full crunchy hazelnut in the center, and a wonderful creamy 
        hazelnut filling.The Ferrero family was the first Italian manufacturer after the Second World War 
        to open production sites and offices abroad in the confectionary sector, turning the company into a true international player.
        Ferrero RocherÂ®, one of the most iconic brands of the Ferrero Group was created in 1982 in Alba, 
        a small town in the hills of Piedmont in Italy. It was inspired by the desire to make all the pleasure 
        of a sophisticated chocolate speciality accessible to a much wider public.</p>
