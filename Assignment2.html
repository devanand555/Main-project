            <img src="C:\Users\anand\Downloads\f.jpg " alt="Ferrero Rocher Logo" width="400" height="300">
            <p>Today, it is one of the world's largest sweet-packaged food companies, with over 35 iconic 
            brands sold in more than 170 countries. The Ferrero Group brings joy to people around the world 
            with much-loved treats and snacks, including Nutella速, Kinder速, Tic Tac速 and Ferrero Rocher速.
            Following a protracted period of research and development for excellence, Ferrero Rocher was founded in 1982. 
            Ever since its introduction, Ferrero Rocher has been acknowledged as a genuine representation of Ferrero quality and 
            perfection because of its exceptional and exclusive recipe, sophisticated golden wrapper, and unusual clear packaging.
            Over the years, the Ferrero Group expanded its portfolio to more than 35 much-loved brands. Consumers in over 170 countries 
            can now enjoy our brands in many different forms, across biscuits, snacks, ice creams and more.
            Part of what made Ferrero Rocher so successful among South Asians was that it exuded luxury but was attainable for new immigrants.
            That connotation, however, is slowly but surely changing. During and after World War II, Italy faced a cocoa shortage</p>
